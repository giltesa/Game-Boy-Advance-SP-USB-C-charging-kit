# Source Code Availability Notice

The source code for the electronic circuits previously shared in this repository is **no longer publicly available**.

This decision has been made due to repeated misuse of the shared materials by third parties who have used the code to manufacture and sell products derived from this work for commercial gain, in violation of the license under which it was originally shared.

The original license explicitly **prohibits commercial use** of this work without proper authorization. Unfortunately, the terms of the license were not respected, which undermines the purpose of sharing the source code and the trust of the community.

Thank you for your understanding and respect for intellectual property rights.
